## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites <img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/sixl/image/upload/v1534412781/GitHub/brands/nodejs-new-pantone-black.png' align="right">

You need [Node.js¬Æ](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to run this app. 

The Node Package Manager (npm) is distributed with Node.js. When you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

Download the latest stable release from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/]() and install it with default settings. On Linux and macOS, you can install Node via the package manager, [as described here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

To verify your installation open your terminal and look up where node and npm were installed and check their versions:

```console
foo@bar:~$ which node && node -v
foo@bar:~$ which npm && npm -v
```

### Installing

1. **Clone or download this repository**  
Change to a folder you want the app folder in. Then clone the files of this repo to a new directory and changee into it: 

```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/Sixl-Daniel/fend-neighborhood-map.git NewAppDirectory
foo@bar:~$ cd NewAppDirectory
```

2. **Install project dependencies**

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**

```console

```

Then point your browser to [http://localhost:3000/]() to see the app.

## Deployment

Build the app for production to the `/build` folder:

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm run build
```

Open your `package.json` and edit the homepage field. The app is now ready to be deployed. 

You can use a static web hosting service like [surge](http://surge.sh/), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Zeit](https://zeit.co/) for fast and easy publishing.
